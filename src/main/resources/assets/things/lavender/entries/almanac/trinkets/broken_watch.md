One would be forgiven for assuming that a {light_purple}Broken Watch{} isn't of much use. However, preserving one
using [Gleaming Compound](^things:items/gleaming_materials) turns out to have a positive outcome for any active
{gold}Potion Effects{}. In fact, it {gold}extends their duration by 50%{}. Given the immense force required for breaking
a {light_purple}Clock{}, simply using a {gold}Crafting Table{} is not an option.

Instead, throw some {light_purple}Leather{}, a {light_purple}Clock{} as well as a piece of {gold}Gleaming Compound{}
onto the ground...

...and {gold}crush them with a piston{}.
