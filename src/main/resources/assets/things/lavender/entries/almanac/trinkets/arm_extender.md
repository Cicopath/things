Given that punching foes and rock is apparently one of the most exercised activities in a game of Minecraft,
{gold}having extended reach{} would no doubt ease one's everyday life. Almost like it was purpose-made, the
{light_purple}Arm Extender{} exists to fulfill that job. More-or-less equivalent to strapping a *really heavy piston* to
the end of your arm, it {gold}extends your reach by two blocks{}.
