{light_purple}Gleaming Ore{} is most important in the majority of endeavours aiming to create a {gold}Thing{}. It can be
found deep within the bowels of the earth where the stones meet, and will drop
some [Gleaming Powder](^things:items/gleaming_materials) if harvested using at least a {light_purple}Diamond Pickaxe{}.
Enchanting this tool with {gold}Fortune{} could prove useful when ore is sparse, although the increase in yield might
disappoint.
