Slapping a {light_purple}Lava Bucket{} onto a {light_purple}Blaze Rod{} reinforced with a few
{light_purple}Netherite Ingots{} seems like a great idea, doesn't it? Well, it sure does make for a good weapon! By
heating up {light_purple}Fire Charges{}, the {light_purple}Infernal Scepter{} makes them go airborne, and thereby
potentially deadly. This process is very intense though,

and even the incredible toughness of Netherite can not
withstand it forever.
