It turns out that by taking advantage of {light_purple}Glowing Ink's{} peculiar properties, an {light_purple}Ender
Pearl{} can be instructed to take the user to a specific location stored on a {light_purple}Displacement Page{}. These
pages are too fragile to be used on their own however, and as such need to be contained in a {light_purple}Displacement
Tome{}. The added bonus is that it allows one to inscribe said pages.

;;;;;

This is achieved by opening the Tome when in possession of one or more {light_purple}Displacement Pages{} and clicking
the {gold}+{} icon, which will create a new entry in the Tome and insert the page. One can edit a page's content by
{gold}Right-Clicking{}, which even allows the user to discard it! The Tome also holds an internal buffer of
{light_purple}Ender Pearls{}, filled by {gold}Shift-Right-Clicking{} it.
