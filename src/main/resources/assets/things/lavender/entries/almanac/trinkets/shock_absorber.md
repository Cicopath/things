Everyone knows the pain of smashing one's head into a wall or feet into the ground at terminal velocity. Conveniently,
the {light_purple}Shock Absorber{} exists to lessen the impact. Being a stylish pair of shoes made mostly of
{light_purple}Phantom Membrane{} and {light_purple}Wool{}, held together by
some [Gleaming Compound](^things:items/gleaming_materials), it is capable of {gold}reducing both fall and kinetic damage
by 75%{}.
