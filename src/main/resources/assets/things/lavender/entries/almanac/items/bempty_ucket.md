A rather more recent invention (yet surely of no less concern), the {light_purple}Bempty Ucket{} is a derivative of the
[Bater Wucket](^things:items/bater_wucket).

<recipe;things:bempty_ucket>

;;;;;

In a surprising turn of events (ok yes, everybody saw this coming) it is capable of {gold}picking up infinite amounts{}
of any fluid and voiding them. While certainly useful in a variety of situations, this power should be used responsibly -
once a bucket of fluid has been
taken in by the {light_purple}Bempty Ucket{}, there is {gold}no way to retrieve it{}.
