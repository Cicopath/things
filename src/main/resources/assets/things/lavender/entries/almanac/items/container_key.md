The {light_purple}Container Key{} might prove a pretty useful utility to those keen on protecting their belongings. By
{gold}Shift-Right-Clicking{} on any container (eg. Chest, Furnace, ...) it will be locked and can only be opened again
using this {gold}one specific{} key until one chooses to unlock it again. This can be done just as easily by
{gold}Shift-Right-Clicking{} with the key again.

One should keep in mind however, that, to those so inclined, overcoming this protection should prove trivial by simply
destroying the container in question.
