Strapping a {light_purple}Wax Gland{} to your feet is actually a great idea. Similar to its paragon in nature, a waxed
lower body makes you float. Moreover, the {light_purple}Gleaming Compound{} mixed into this particular gland bestows
upon you great speed in water, turning it a very effective means of transport.

in conjunction with a [Hades Crystal](^things:trinkets/hades_crystal)
