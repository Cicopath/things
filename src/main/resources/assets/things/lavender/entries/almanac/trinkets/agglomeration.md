While building out one's supply of trinkets, a certain annoyance is often encountered - the need to choose between
trinkets which occupy the same slot. Wouldn't it be *truly* great to wear two trinkets in a single slot? Luckily, the
{light_purple}Agglomeration{} exists to fill precisely that purpose.

To begin, one must craft themselves

;;;;;

<recipe;things:empty_agglomeration>

an {light_purple}Empty Agglomeration{} as shown above. This must then be combined
with two trinkets of choice in the next step. For obvious reasons, these trinkets {gold}must share at least one slot{}.

It is recommended to take great care when choosing

which trinkets to combine, as historical attempts have shown that separating them afterwards is not possible.
