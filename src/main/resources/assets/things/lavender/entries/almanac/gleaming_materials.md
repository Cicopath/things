{light_purple}Gleaming Powder{}, mined from [Gleaming Ore](^things:gleaming_ore), possesses some pretty useful
magical abilities, to the point where some deranged individuals might consider it a primitive form of life. Although
useless in and of itself, it does enable the creation of a wide range of utilities and trinkets.

Something else to try is covering a {light_purple}Diamond{} in it, which results in the even more powerful
{light_purple}Gleaming Compound{}.
