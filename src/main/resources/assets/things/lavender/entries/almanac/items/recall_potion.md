Quite possibly a concept as old as Minecraft itself, the {light_purple}Recall Potion{} allows the user to instantly
return to their {gold}Spawnpoint{} by exploiting some subspace shenanigans, whose inner workings we're still unsure
about. This magical brew can be attained by imbuing an {light_purple}Awkward Potion{} with the powers of an
{light_purple}Ender Pearl{} in a {gold}Brewing Stand{}.
