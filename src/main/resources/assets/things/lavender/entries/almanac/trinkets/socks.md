Everybody knows that all the cool kids have socks. As such, it is of course possible to obtain a pair for oneself.
Easily obtained using some {light_purple}Wool{} adorned with [Gleaming Powder](^things:items/gleaming_materials), they
provide an instant {gold}speed boost{}. Should there be a need for even greater swiftness, the {light_purple}Socks{} may
be upgraded with a {gold}String Potion of Swiftness{} and some [Gleaming Powder](^things:items/gleaming_materials).

Similarly, a {light_purple}Rabbit Foot Charm{} may be integrated, consuming one {light_purple}Gleaming Compound{}. This
will bestow upon the wearer {gold}Jump Boost II{} as well as {gold}step-assist{}. Said {light_purple}Jump Boost{} may
also be toggled by {gold}sneaking for one second while sprinting{}.
